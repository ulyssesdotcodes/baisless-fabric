> Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\
> As I foretold you, were all spirits and \
> Are melted into air, into thin air: \
> And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, \
> The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, \
> The solemn temples, the great globe itself, \
> Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve \
> And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, \
> Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff \
> As dreams are made on, and our little life \
> Is rounded with a sleep.

\- Prospero, **Shakespeare**, *The Tempest* (Act 4, Scene 1)
